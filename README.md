# Description
Note(d) is fun and creative app to store your most valued notes! It was built with developers in mind to store all those great ideas and thoughts you may need later. It allows you to add customized tags to your note so when you're needing it a little later in life, you can retrieve them conveniently. You can go to sleep at night knowing that your notes are stored securely with our thoughtful authorization or GitHub OAuth, just waiting for you to log back in. Jump in and write a couple notes!
